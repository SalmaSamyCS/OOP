Biotechnology Overview
Biotechnology uses biological systems, living organisms, or their parts to develop new products.

Examples: Brewing and baking bread (use of yeast).

Four main types of biotechnology:

Red: Medical

White: Industrial

Green: Environmental

Blue: Marine

Alexander Fleming & Penicillin
Discovered penicillin in 1928 from Penicillium rubens mold.

Called it the "single greatest victory ever achieved over disease."

Shared 1945 Nobel Prize with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain.

Also discovered enzyme lysozyme in 1922 and bacterium Micrococcus luteus.

Griffith's Experiment (1928)
Studied Streptococcus pneumoniae (S and R strains).

S strain: Virulent, has polysaccharide coat.

R strain: Harmless, no coat.

Found that heat-killed S strain + live R strain → mice died → live S strain found in blood.

Concluded a "transforming principle" converted R to S strain.

Avery–MacLeod–McCarty Experiment (1944)
Goal: Identify Griffith's "transforming principle."

Removed proteins, RNA, and finally DNA from heat-killed S extract.

Only DNA removal stopped transformation of R strain.

Concluded DNA is the transforming (genetic) material, not protein.

Hershey–Chase Experiment (1952)
Used bacteriophages (viruses made of DNA & protein).

Labeled DNA with radioactive phosphorus-32 (³²P).

Labeled protein with radioactive sulfur-35 (³⁵S).

After infection & centrifugation:

³²P (DNA) found inside bacterial cells (pellet).

³⁵S (protein) stayed outside (supernatant).

Conclusion: DNA, not protein, is genetic material.

Gene Transfer Mechanisms
1. Vertical Gene Transfer

From parent to offspring.

2. Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT or LGT)

Between individuals of same/different species.

Major driver of evolution, virulence, and antibiotic resistance.

Mechanisms:

a. Transduction

Bacteriophage injects DNA into bacteria.

May accidentally transfer bacterial genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance).

b. Transformation

Uptake of free DNA from environment.

If DNA is similar to host’s, it may integrate into the chromosome.

c. Conjugation

DNA transfer via pilus from donor to recipient cell.

Involves F factor (fertility plasmid).

Recipient becomes F⁺ and can donate DNA.

d. Transfection (in eukaryotes only)

Artificial DNA introduction via:

Chemical methods (e.g., calcium phosphate)

Physical methods (e.g., electroporation, microinjection)

Transposable Elements ("Jumping Genes")
DNA segments that move within a genome.

Can carry antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity genes.

If moved into plasmids, can be spread via transformation or conjugation.
Vectors in Molecular Cloning
Vectors are DNA molecules used to deliver foreign genetic material into host cells in molecular cloning.

A vector carrying foreign DNA is called recombinant DNA.

Major types of vectors include:

Plasmids – circular, extra-chromosomal DNA found in bacteria.

Viral vectors – modified viruses used to deliver genes.

Cosmids – plasmid–phage hybrids.

Artificial chromosomes – large vectors like YACs, BACs, and HACs.

Expression vectors contain promoter sequences that enable expression of the inserted gene (transgene) in host cells.

A vector usually consists of:

Insert (transgene)

Backbone – provides structural and functional elements

Plasmids
Small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules separate from chromosomal DNA.

Found in bacteria and some eukaryotes.

Range in size: 2 kb to 200 kb.

Replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome (due to their origin of replication).

Often carry non-essential genes that offer survival advantages, such as antibiotic resistance.

May contain TRA genes, which allow plasmid transfer via conjugation.

Structure of a Plasmid
Origin of replication (Ori) – A=T rich region for easy strand separation.

Selectable marker site – usually antibiotic resistance genes.

Promoter region – binds transcription machinery.

Primer binding site – needed for amplification/sequencing.

Multiple cloning site (MCS) – has restriction enzyme sites for inserting foreign DNA.

Plasmids Under Stress
Carrying a plasmid uses energy, but it helps the bacteria survive in stressful conditions (e.g., antibiotic presence).

Bacteria with plasmids survive and reproduce, passing the plasmid on to others.

Bacteria without plasmids are less likely to survive under such conditions.

Types of Plasmids
By TRA Gene Presence
Conjugative plasmids – contain TRA genes; can transfer themselves between cells.

Non-conjugative plasmids – lack TRA genes; cannot transfer independently.

By Function
Fertility (F) Plasmids

Contain TRA genes.

Help form pili for conjugation.

Can replicate in host and contribute to incompatibility mechanisms.

Resistance (R) Plasmids

Carry antibiotic resistance genes.

Protect bacteria from natural or synthetic antibiotics.

Large size; usually low copy number.

Col (Colicin) Plasmids

Encode bacteriocins (toxic proteins).

Kill closely related bacteria lacking Col plasmids.

Common in E. coli.

Degradative Plasmids

Encode enzymes that allow digestion of unusual compounds (e.g., toluene, camphor).

Help bacteria survive in unique environments.

Virulence Plasmids

Enable bacteria to infect hosts (plants, animals, humans).

Ti plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease in plants.

Viral Vectors
Genetically modified viruses (non-infectious).

Carry viral promoters and the transgene.

Enable high efficiency of gene delivery and expression via viral machinery.

Artificial Chromosomes
Synthetic chromosomes: YACs, BACs, HACs.

Can carry very large DNA fragments (up to 300,000 base pairs).

Must have:

Origin of replication

Centromere

Telomeric sequences

Why Plasmids Are Excellent Vectors
Selectable markers (e.g., antibiotic resistance) help isolate only bacteria that have taken up the plasmid.

Independent replication allows for many copies per cell.

Circular structure allows easy insertion and reintegration of foreign DNA.

Historical Note
Joshua Lederberg coined the term plasmid in 1952.

He won the 1958 Nobel Prize for discovering bacterial conjugation.

The term was based on his work with Salmonella and bacteriophage P22. 
Recombinant DNA Technology (rDNA)
A method to cut and join DNA from different sources using enzymes.

The new DNA is put into a vector (like a plasmid), which carries it into a host cell for replication or protein production.

Restriction Enzymes (Restriction Endonucleases)
Produced by bacteria to cut foreign DNA, protecting against viruses (bacteriophages).

Discovered in the 1960s by Werner Arber, Hamilton Smith, and Daniel Nathans.

Each enzyme recognizes a specific DNA sequence (called a recognition site) and cuts the DNA at or near this site.

The cut is done by breaking the phosphodiester bond between nucleotides.

Bacteria protect their own DNA by methylating their recognition sites with enzymes called methylases.

Example:

EcoRI (from E. coli):
Cuts at:

objectivec
Copy
Edit
5’-GAATTC-3’  
3’-CTTAAG-5’  
Produces sticky ends:

objectivec
Copy
Edit
5’-G     AATTC-3’  
3’-CTTAA     G-5’
Types of Ends
Sticky Ends
Produced by enzymes like EcoRI or HindIII.

Have single-stranded overhangs that base-pair with matching sequences.

Easier to join with DNA ligase.

Blunt Ends
Produced by enzymes like SmaI:

Copy
Edit
CCC|GGG  
GGG|CCC  
No overhangs; harder to join, but more versatile (no need for specific sequences).

Blunt-end cloning uses T4 DNA ligase and can be faster in some cases.

DNA Ligase
Enzyme that joins DNA fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds.

Essential for DNA repair, replication, and cloning.

Types
E. coli DNA ligase: uses NAD+, not efficient with blunt ends.

T4 DNA ligase (from a virus): uses ATP, works with both blunt and sticky ends (commonly used in labs).

Mammals: have DNA ligase I, III, IV (DNA ligase II is a breakdown product of III).

Mechanism
Enzyme is activated by AMP.

AMP attaches to the 5’ end of DNA.

A phosphodiester bond forms between the 3’ OH and 5’ phosphate ends.

DNA Cloning
Process of making identical copies of a DNA piece.

Steps:
Cut & Paste DNA

Use restriction enzymes to cut both insert DNA and plasmid.

Use DNA ligase to join them, forming recombinant DNA.

Transformation

Insert recombinant plasmid into bacteria (e.g., E. coli) using heat shock.

The plasmid usually has an antibiotic resistance gene.

Selection

Grow bacteria on a plate with antibiotics.

Only those with the plasmid survive and form colonies.

Protein Production

Bacteria make proteins from the inserted gene (e.g., insulin).

Proteins are purified from bacterial cells for use.

Uses of DNA Cloning
Biopharmaceuticals: Produce proteins like insulin.

Gene Therapy: Insert normal genes into patients to treat genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis).

Gene Analysis: Study gene function in research labs.
